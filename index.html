                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in Florida. I graduated from school there and worked my first job for a local government contractor. But when I turned 23, I decided it was time to give up what I knew and completely 
                    switch it up. That year I moved to Seattle after getting a job with DocuSign (my current employer). It was the most terrifying decision I've ever made and I still can't believe I did it. But I haven't
                    ever regretted moving to this city. I got what I was looking for: something that was entirely different than what I was used to. It was honestly like moving to the future. And I was lucky enough to have
                    made friends right when I settled in (avoiding the Seattle Freeze).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since being here, not only have I grown leaps and bounds as a developer, but I've also been introduced to a hobby that I hope to be able to do until my fingers fall off: climbing. More specifically, I boulder
                    twice a week. But sometimes my climbing partner and I make it outdoors to sport climb when the weather is nice. There's something amazing about challening both your body and mind at the same time; pushing yourself to the point
                    of thinking you have nothing left to give, and you can't figure out what to do, willing yourself to accomplish the impossible anyway. A lot of times I wind up falling off of the wall, hitting things along
                    the way. But I get right back up and try again. I love it.
                </p>

                    When I'm not developing or injuring myself, I'm often reading something new, snuggled on the couch with my cat when it's cold and rainy. I love watching new movies in the theater to get the whole experience.
                    And of course hanging out with friends, stuffing my face with food that I really shouldn't be eating but it's so good.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is my goal to always keep growing as a person in all facets of my life. A journey that should never end, nor would I ever want it to.
