                    I was born and raised in Florida. I graduated from school there and worked my first job for a local government contractor. But when I turned 23, I decided it was time to give up what I knew and completely 
                    switch it up. That year I moved to Seattle after getting a job with DocuSign (my current employer). It was the most terrifying decision I've ever made and I still can't believe I did it. But I haven't
                    ever regretted moving to this city. I got what I was looking for: something that was entirely different than what I was used to. It was honestly like moving to the future. And I was lucky enough to have
                    made friends right when I settled in (avoiding the Seattle Freeze).
